Option #3: Uber Engineering: The Opportunities Microservices Provide

I&#39;m choosing this option because after reading the two articles provided, what stood out to me was Uber&#39;s currency and exchange rate service, Tincup which uses two different endpoints such as one to get a currency object and a second to get the current exchange rate for a given currency. I also choose it because the company describes the structure of their different Microservice layers such as MVC and UDR. Uber has also built a system that prepares for natural disasters that occur which will cause an increase in the number of microservices. Lastly, the company provides an opportunity for many people to own services even with limited experiences. Overall, Uber provides a knowledge sharing culture that gives a codebased experience.
